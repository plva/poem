A simple poem-learning tool to be used in the command line.

Uses EMACS-like keybindings:

	'f' : show next word
	'n' : move down one line
	'p' : move up one line
	'a' : move to the beginning of the line (and clear it)
	'q' : quit


Run it by passing a file name that holds a poem:
	$ ./poem_learner.py ulysses.txt
	...
	> python poem_learner.py my_poem


How to use it:
	Read the first line out loud, and try to recollect and say the second line.
	
If you need a hint, you can show the next word with 'f', or display the whole next line with 'n'.
